# Miscellaneous
- Two mathematicians that I deeply admire:
  - Jim
  - Michel

- The art of (near) symmetry
- I started playing badminton and chess since I was six -- back when the toughest opponents were still human, not AI-powered robots. I’m also drawn to hiking and the outdoors, and always up for learning new sports.
