# Miscellaneous
- Two mathematicians that I deeply admire:
  - Jim Simons: yes, that Simons.
  - Michel Talagrand: for his profound insight in developing universal methods to approach problems in probability, his exceptional clarity in explaining them, and his great sense of humor.

- The art of (near) symmetry: [link](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16564/branch-of-the-seine-near-giverny-mist)
- I started playing badminton and chess since I was six --- back when the toughest opponents were still human, not AI-powered robots. I’m also drawn to hiking and the outdoors, and always up for learning new sports.
- I enjoy cooking and trying new places when I can, secretly hoping that someday I might become an okay chef.
- Some of my favorite writings:
  - 兰亭集序 (Lantingji Xu)
  - Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions
  - The World of Yesterday: Memoires of a European

- "莫说相公痴，更有痴似相公者。" --- 《湖心亭看雪》 张岱 <br>
  Say not my passion madness, as I am not alone.
