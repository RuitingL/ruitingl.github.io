      Hi! I am a fifth year PhD student in <a href="https://cam.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">Computational and Applied Mathematics</a> at the University of Chicago, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://rinafb.github.io" target="_blank">Rina Foygel Barber</a>. Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
  </p>
    <p>
      I work on the theory of statistical problems in machine learning, with the goal of understanding uncertainty in general settings with as few assumptions as possible. My research topics include distribution-free inference, algorithmic stability, and uncertainty quantification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also collaborate with astrophysicists on hypothesis testing problems arising in astronomical data analysis, with the support from the <a href="https://skai-institute.org" target="_blank">NSF–Simons AI Institute for the Sky (SkAI institute)</a>.
