      Hi! I am a fifth year PhD student in <a href="https://cam.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">Computational and Applied Mathematics</a>. at the University of Chicago, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rina Foygel Barber](https://rinafb.github.io). Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    <p>
      I work on the theory of statistical problems in machine learning, with the goal of understanding uncertainty in general settings with as few assumptions as possible. My research topics include distribution-free inference, algorithmic stability, and uncertainty quantification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also collaborate with astrophysicists on hypothesis testing problems arising in astronomical data analysis, with support from the [NSF–Simons AI Institute for the Sky (SkAI institute)](https://skai-institute.org).
